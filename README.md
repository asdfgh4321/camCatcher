# Cam Catcher

This is my try to make a program that will take a picture of who ever is trying to unlock my computer.

The reason for including SFML is because openCV's waitKey(milliSec)==key doesn't work if I don't start a graphical window, a other side note is that the reason for SFML/Graphics.hpp and not SFML/Keyboard.hpp is because for some reason it doesn't work with SFML/Keyboard.hpp for the keys. Might be my compile options.
## Put on hold
This project is put on hold due to school taking more time.
